-- This code is half-written. To be completed by students. 
-- The goal is showing the value of data_in input on the segments_out output.

-- Each segment of a, b, c, d, e, f, and g can be turned ON or OFF independently. 
-- The following line is from page 32 of the C5G_User_Manual document available on FPGA_Datasheets folder on LEARN. 
-- "Applying a low logic level to a segment will light it up and applying a high logic level turns it off."
