    "Decision Rules for Human Agents:\n",
    "Avoidance: Unlike birds, humans have a higher capability to anticipate the paths of others and adjust their walking direction and speed accordingly. This rule involves steering to avoid collisions with oncoming pedestrians while maintaining a comfortable personal space. This could involve slight adjustments in direction or speed when another pedestrian is directly oncoming or within a critical personal space radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed Adjustment: Humans tend to adjust their walking speed based on the density of the crowd. In denser situations, individuals might slow down to navigate through tight spaces. This rule involves decreasing speed as the density of the immediate area increases, simulating more careful navigation through crowded areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal-Oriented Movement: Each individual has a specific destination. Unlike the alignment rule for birds, humans on a crosswalk are more likely to maintain a generally straight trajectory towards their goal (the other side of the crosswalk) but with adjustments for avoidance. The individuals can have a vector representing their desired direction and adjust this vector based on the need for avoidance and speed adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lane Formation: In many human crowds, especially in situations where people are moving in opposite directions, lanes of movement naturally form as individuals align their movements with those heading in the same direction. You could incorporate a rule that encourages alignment with the direction and speed of nearby individuals moving towards the same goal."
